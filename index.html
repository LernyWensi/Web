                    <p>
                        Back-end. As I delve into this field, I am fascinated by the intricacies of building the
                        backbone of websites and applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have the opportunity to work with databases, server-side programming languages, and
                        frameworks, gaining valuable hands-on experience in creating robust and efficient systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I enjoy the challenge of problem-solving and ensuring that data processing, security, and
                        performance are optimized.

                    <p>My hobbies revolve around two main areas: custom keyboards and programming.</p>
                    <p>
                        I absolutely love diving into the world of custom keyboards, where I can design and build
                        keyboards tailored to my preferences. From selecting unique switches to programming the
                        firmware.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the programming side, I enjoy exploring various programming languages and techniques. Whether
                        it's developing software applications or tinkering with firmware.
